Marketing: At this phase, we start marketing the Valireum project using the demo v2 and invite game publishers/investment companies/influencers to get more credibility in the games and the crypto market.

Sales: The first offer is private, we will select a few companies/individuals that we believe they will add more credibility for the project. 

The public offer will be available for everyone and the discount will be varied on each batch.

Exchange listing:

After a successful public offer, we will proceed to add VLM to major exchanges through specialized agencies.

The beta: at this phase Valireum will switch to Ethereum main network, add more tools and templates, VR compatibility, etc.. any games you develop on the beta will be permanent and you can start earning VLMs when you invite users to play your games.

Publishing the game: With the help of a reputable game publisher, the beta will be upgraded and published as Valireum v1 on every game store such as steam, epic store, Vive/Oculus stores.
